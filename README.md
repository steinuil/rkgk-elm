A thing for pixiv. It'll be better later. Maybe.

## Requirements
- Elm 0.18
- Ruby 2.x
- `gem`

## Installing
```
make
bundle install
rackup
```
Navigate to `localhost:9292` in your browser.

## Plans for the future
- Better UI using [history.pushState()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API)
- Support for opening tabs
- Browsing and managing follows, bookmarks, etc
- Release Pixiv.elm as a standalone library
- Saving illustrations and whole artists pages offline
- Better proxy
- Distribute as a binary

## Contributing
I like to think the source is pretty straightforward. You can take a look for yourself once you're done laughing.
